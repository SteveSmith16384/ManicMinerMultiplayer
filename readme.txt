## Instructions
* Up to 4 players compete to be the first to collect all the keys and get to the end of the level.
* Each player must collect all the keys.  The keys will only disappear when the last player has collected their key.
* Once you have all the keys, your avatar will flash indicating that you can go to the exit.


## Controls
* Keyboard: Either "W, A, D and Space", or "Q, O, P and Space"
* Should work with most controllers
* Esc - quit


## Running on Linux
You will probably need to mark the program as an executable before Linux will allow you to run it.


## Running on a Mac
Since the app is not signed for a Mac (I don't even have a Mac), it shows "Application from unidentified developer" or even "Application is damaged and cannot Be opened" on first start. Try to open you game with Ctrl+Right Click and then Open. If it's not helping, open Terminal, enter "sudo xattr -cr /Path/To/JetPac.app" and then open your game.
